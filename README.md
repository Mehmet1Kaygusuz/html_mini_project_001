# HTML Mini Project 001

![Badge Placeholder](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML-Project-blue)  
**Version:** 1.0.0

A simple HTML-only project created as part of my early web development journey. This project helped me practice semantic structure, clean formatting, and basic page organization.

## 🚀 Purpose of the Project

- To practice writing clean and structured HTML
- To learn and apply semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`
- To build a simple “About Me” page layout
- To understand how to organize content using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links

This project represents **Day 1** of my path toward becoming a software engineer.
